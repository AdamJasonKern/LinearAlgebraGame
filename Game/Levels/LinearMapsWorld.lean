Title "Linear Maps World"

Introduction "
Welcome to Linear Maps World! This world will introduce you to formalizing proofs about linear maps
<<<<<<< HEAD
in Lean. This world includes proofs about bases and dimension, for example if a subspace has the same

=======
in Lean. This world starts with proofs about inner products, and eventually, you prove the Cauchy Schwarz
