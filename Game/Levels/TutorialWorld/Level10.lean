Title "The `induction'` tactic"

/--
## Summary

If `n : ℕ` is an object, and the goal mentions `n`, then `induction' n with d hd`
attempts to prove the goal by induction on `n`, with the inductive
variable in the successor case being `d`, and the inductive hypothesis being `hd`.

### Example:
If the goal is
```
0 + n = n
```

then

`induction' n with d hd`

will turn it into two goals. The first is `0 + 0 = 0`;
the second has an assumption `hd : 0 + d = d` and goal
`0 + succ d = succ d`.

Note that you must prove the first
goal before you can access the second one.

'add_succ' is a proof that `n + Nat.succ m = Nat.succ (n + m)`.

The reason for the name is that the theorem proves that adding the successor of a number is equal to
the successor of addind that number.

Introduction "
The `induction'` tactic is a powerful tool to help you to prove statments involving natural numbers.
It splits a proof into two cases: a base case and an inductive step. The base case is the smallest
natural number you need to prove the proof for. The inductive step proves the theorem for all other
numbers. In the inductive step, you can assume the theorem holds for some value `d`, and must then
prove that it holds for `d + 1`, also written as `Nat.succ d`, the successor of `d`. Induction can
also be used to prove theorems about objects indexed my natural numbers, such as vectors whose
dimension can be described by a natural number.

The syntax for the `induction'` tactic is `induction' n with d hd`. As long as `n` is an arbirtary
natural number in the proof, this will do induction on `n`, where `d` is the number you assume the
theorem holds for in the inductive step, and `hd` is the induction hypothesis you will get.

This level also uses a new theorem: `add_succ`. `add_succ` is a proof that
`n + Nat.succ m = Nat.succ (n + m)`, for any `n, m : ℕ`.
