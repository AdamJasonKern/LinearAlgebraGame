Title "Challenge Level - Linear Independence of Set with Insertion"

Introduction "This is your first challenge level! It is meant to be an optional challenge for those
who want to have more practice proving difficult theorems in Lean.

### The Goal
The goal of this level is to prove that if you have some linearly independent set of vectors `S`, and
some vector `v ∉ span S`, then the set `S ∪ {v}` is also linearly independent.

### How to skip the level
In this level, you will have access to the `sorry` tactic. This tactic is how you tell Lean \"I couldn't
finish the proof, but pretend like I did.\" Typing this tactic will always solve the goal, and allow
you to skip the level

### Proof overview
Linear independence means that any linear combination that adds to zero must be all zeros. This means
that in order to show `S ∪ {v}` is linearly independent, you must introduce an arbitrary linear combination
with the function `f` over a set `s`. Here, you can consider whether `v ∈ s` or not. If not, the proof
is simple, since `s` is a subset of `S` we already know `S` is linearly independent. If it is, we need
to prove `f(v) = 0`. This can be done since `v ∉ span S`, along with some clever choice of functions.
Once you have `f(v) = 0`, you can show that the function must be zero outside of `v` due to the linear
independence of `S`, which then shows `f` is zero on `s`.

### New tactics/theorems
Similarly to the last level, there are new tactics and theorems you can read about to the right side.
Also, something that may be useful is the `⁻¹` function. `x⁻¹` is the multiplicative inverse of `x`.

`sorry` allows you to skip levels. The `sorry` tactic will solve any goal, and although it is not actually
a proof, Lean treats it as one.

## Summary
`by_contra` allows you to prove theorems by contradiction. When your goal is `P`, `by_contra h` will
create a hypothesis `h : ¬P` and change the goal to `False`.

## Example
If your goal is `¬(isRational √2)`, using `by_contra h` will change the goal to `False`, and
give you a hypothesis `h : isRational √2`.

If you have some set s, where you know `h : i ∈ s`, then `sum_eq_sum_diff_singleton_add h` is a proof that
`(Finset.sum s fun x => f x) = (Finset.sum (s \ {i}) fun x => f x) + f i`

`smul_sum` is a proof that you can distribute scalar multiplication through `Finset.sum`.

/--
`inv_mul_cancel` is a proof that multiplying a nonzero inverse gives 1. If you have a hypothesis `h : x ≠ 0`,
then  `inv_mul_cancel h` is a proof that `x⁻¹ * x = 1`

/--
`linear_independent_insert_of_not_in_span` is a proof that if you have a linearly independent set, and
you insert an element not in the span of that set, the new set is also linearly independent. The syntax
is as follows: if you have hypotheses `hS : linear_independent_v K V S`, and `hv_not_span : v ∉ span K V S`,
then `linear_independent_insert_of_not_in_span hS hv_not_span` is a proof of `linear_independent_v K V (S ∪ {v})`.
