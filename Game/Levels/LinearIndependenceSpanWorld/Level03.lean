Title "Monotonicity of Span"

Introduction "
### The Goal
In this level, you will prove that the span of a set of vectors is monotonic. That is, that if `A ⊆ B`,
then `span K V A ⊆ span K V B`. To understand why this is true, think about any arbitrary vector `x ∈ span K V A`.
`x` must be a linear combination of vectors of `A`, and since all those vectors are in `A`, they must
also be in `B`, so `x` is a linear combination of vectors in `B`, and must be in `span K V B`.

### `subset_trans`
To solve this level, we need a theorem `subset_trans`. This theorem shows that subsets are transitive,
so if you have `h1 : A ⊆ B` and `h2 : B ⊆ C`, then `subset_trans h1 h2` is a proof that `A ⊆ C`. This can be proven quite easily, but since we have
a theorem already proving it, why not use it?

/--
`subset_trans` is a proof that subsets are transitive. The syntax is that if you have `h1 : A ⊆ B`
and `h2 : B ⊆ C`, then `subset_trans h1 h2` is a proof that `A ⊆ C`.

`span_mono` is a proof that the span of sets is monotonic. Simply, this means that if you have `h : A ⊆ B`,
then `span_mono K V h` is a proof that `span K V A ⊆ span K V B`.

  Hint "First, I would take an arbitrary `x`, then unfold and simplify our goals."

  exact subset_trans hsA hAB
  Hint "What function should we be using?"
  Hint (hidden := true) "Try `use f`"
  use f

Conclusion "The idea of unfolding all the definitions and then using `simp at *` is very helpful. I
would recommend using this sequence of tactics at the start of most levels.

Also, note that `use f` closed the goal. This is because the `use` tactic attempts `rfl` after it
executes, similarly to `rw`."
