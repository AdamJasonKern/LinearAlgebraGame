Title "Challenge Level - Span After Removing Elements"

Introduction "
This is the second challenge level, and the last level of the Linear Independence and Span World! Similar
to the first challenge level, this level is optional and can be skipped with the `sorry` tactic, but you can
play through it if you want more practice.

### The Goal
The goal of this level is to prove that if you have some set `S`, and some vector `w` inside the span
of `S \\ {w}`, the span of `S` is the same as the span of `S \\ {w}`. This is because `w` can be written
as a sum of vectors of `S \\ {w}`, so any time you have `w` appear in a linear combination of `S`, you
can simply replace it with a sum of vectors in `S \\ {w}`.

### Proof overview
The most difficult part of this proof is showing that given a linear representation of a vector in the
span of `S`, we can represent it as a sum of vectors in `S \\ {w}`. You are able to represent a sum over
`S` as a sum over `S \\ {w}` plus the function applied to `w`. Then, rewrite `w` as a sum of vectors
in `S \\ {w}`, and recombine the sums.

`subset_insert` is a proof that any set is a subset of itself with an element inserted. In Lean, the
syntax is as follows: if `s : Set T` is a set, and you have `x : T`, then `s ⊆ Set.insert x s`

## Summary
`tauto` solves goals using simple logic. It works similarly to the `simp` and `linarith` tactics, in
that there is not just one use case. If there is a contradiction that can be easily inferred, or if
the goal is a direct result of the hypotheses, `tauto` will solve the goal.

## Example
If your goal is of the form `P ∨ ¬P`, then `tauto will solve the goal.

## Example
If your goal is of the form `A ∨ B`, and you have a hypothesis `h : A ∨ (B ∧ C)`, then `tauto` will
solve the goal.

## Summary
`let` acts very similarly to `have`. Instead of allowing you to create new hypotheses, `let` allows you
to create new objects.

## Using `rw` after `let` statements
You may want to use `rw` with the equalities you choose in a `let` statement. To do this, you must create
a new lemma stating this equality with `have`. The proof will simply be `rfl`.

## Example
If you have objects `x y : V`, then you can say `let z := x + y`, and you will have a new object `z`,
where `z = x + y` can be solvedd by `rfl`

## Example
If you have a function `f : V → K`, and `v : V`, you can say `let f := fun x => f x • v`.

`ite` stands for `if then else`. If is used when creating functions. You can think of `ite P f1 f2` as
"If P then f1 else f2". This function gives you f1 when P is True, and f2 otherwise. This can help you
design functions that are 0 outside of certain sets.
