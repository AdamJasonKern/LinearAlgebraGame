Title "Zero must belong"

Introduction "Now that we understand more about vector spaces, let's define what a subspace is.
Intuitively, a subspace is a subset of a vector space that can be considered as a vector space itself.
We define this as a subset `W : Set V` that is nonempty, is closed under addition, and is closed under scalar multiplication.

### The `obtain` tactic
A new tactic will help us solve problems with subspaces. While not necessary, and this tactic can
even be completely replaced by the `cases'` tactic, it will simplify your proofs greatly. The `obtain`
tactic essentially acts as repeating `cases'`. In this level, it has two main uses. First, if `hw : isSubspace W`
is a hypothesis, then `obtain ⟨h1, h2, h3⟩ := hW` will split the definition into the three parts,
labeled h1, h2, and h3. The other important use for `obtain` is if you have a hypothesis `hW : W.Nonempty`,
then `obtain ⟨w, hw⟩ := hW` will give you a `w : V`, and a hypothesis `hw : w ∈ W`. The \"⟨\"
character is written with \"\\langle\", and the \"⟩\" character is written with \"\\rangle\".

### Subspace contains zero
One of the basic properties of a subspace is that it must be nonempty. In fact, every subspace must
contain the zero vector. This is because for any vector in a subspace, you can multiply it by the zero
scalar while still remaining in the subspace, which wil result in the zero vector. In this level, we
formally prove this result.

A subspace is a subset of a vector space that acts similarly to a vector space itself. It has three
main properties:
- Nonempty: a subspace cannot be empty
- Closure under addition: adding any two elements of a subspace should remain in that subspace
- Closure under scalar multiplication: scaling any vector in a subspace should remanin in that subspace

Subspaces are formalized by having the `isSubspace` proposition, which simply combines the three
properties into one proposition.

## Summary
The `obtain` tactic works very similar to repeating the `cases'` tactic. The `obtain` tactic splits a
statement into cases, and allows you to name each case. Instead of splitting into two cases, like the
`cases'` tactic, `obtain` can split into as many cases as necessary. The syntax looks like
`obtain ⟨h1, h2, h3⟩ := h`.

## Example
If `hw : isSubspace W` is a hypothesis, then `obtain ⟨h1, h2, h3⟩ := hW` will split the definition
into three parts, labeled h1, h2, and h3.

## Example
If you have a hypothesis `hW : W.Nonempty`, where `W : Set V` is a subset of `V`, then
`obtain ⟨w, hw⟩ := hW` will give you a `w : V`, and a hypothesis `hw : w ∈ W`
