Title "Vector space intro, zero scalar multiplication"

## Summary
The `symm` tactic stands for symmetry of equality. It shows that if we know `a = b`, then `b = a`.

## Example
If your goal is `a = b`, `symm` will change the goal to `b = a`.

## Example
If you have a hypothesis `h: a = b`, `symm at h` will change the hypothesis to `h: b = a`.

## Example
If you have a theorem `add_dist: ∀ a b c, (a + b) * c = a * c + b * c`, and a goal `2 * x + 5 * x = y`,
`rw[(add_dist 2 5 x).symm]` will change the goal to `(2 + 5) * x = y`.

Introduction "
## Vector Space Definition

We begin by defining a vector space `V` over a field `K` as an abelian group with four key axioms:

```
class VectorSpace (K V : Type) [Field K] [AddCommGroup V] extends Module K V where
  smul_add_explicit : ∀ (a : K) (x y : V), a • (x + y) = a • x + a • y := smul_add -- Distributivity over vector addition
  add_smul_explicit : ∀ (a b : K) (x : V), (a + b) • x = a • x + b • x := add_smul -- Distributivity over scalar addition
  mul_smul_explicit : ∀ (a b : K) (x : V), (a * b) • x = a • (b • x) := mul_smul -- Associativity of `•` and `*`
  one_smul_explicit : ∀ (x : V), (1 : K) • x = x := one_smul -- The multiplicitave identity acts as an identity
```

This foundational structure will be used throughout all future levels. We are also using Mathlib's `Module`,
`Field`, and `AddCommGroup` definitions, which lets us use notation such as `-a` and `a⁻¹`, and includes
many helpful theorems that we will not need to prove ourselves.

Note that to write the `•` character, type
\"\\smul\".

Also, note that there is some strange `inst†` text in your objects. This simply means that your objects
are instances of certain classes, for example that K V is a vector space.

## Goal for this level

In this level, you'll prove that multiplying a vector by the zero scalar (`0 : K`) results in the
zero vector (`0 : V`). This is going to be a slightly involved proof, so it is important to get an
understanding of the proof before beginning to write it.

The first step of a normal proof would be writing `0 • w` as `(0 + 0) • w`, then using distributivity
to get it as `0 • w + 0 • w`. Lastly, cancelling out a `0 • w` on each side gets `0 = 0 • w`.

However, this proof relies on our assumptions and constructs the goal from them. This can be done in
Lean, however, it requires using the `have` tactic, and is unnescessarily complex. In Lean, proofs are
often done backwards, working from the goal and creating the hypotheses.

Doing the proof backwards thus must first involve adding `0 • w` to both sides of the goal, undoing
distributivity, then cancelling out some zeros.

### add_right_cancel

To use cancellation of addition, we need a new theorem, `add_right_cancel`. This theorem is a proof
that `a + b = c + b → a = c`. Since your goal is of the form `a = c`, `apply add_right_cancel` will
change the goal to `a + ?b = c + ?b`. However, you want to be able to write the value of `?b`, but
in this case, Lean doesn't know what value you want to add. You can tell Lean what to add to the
equation by `apply add_right_cancel (b := ????)`, replacing the question marks with whatever you
want to add.

### zero_add

We also need to know some basic theorems about addition. For both the scalars and vectors, adding any
vector to `0` will result in that vector. Simply `rw [zero_add]` will show this.

### symm

You will also need the `symm` tactic. `symm` stands for symmetry of equality, and it can be used to
change goals of the form `a = b` to `b = a`. `symm at h` will also change a hypothesis `h: a = b` to
`h: b = a`. However, neither of these uses are needed in this level. You may
notice that if `h: a = b` is a hypothesis, rw[h] will rewrite all `a`s to `b`s. What if you want to
rewrite all `b`s to `a`s, you can instead do `rw[h.symm]`.

Also note that when the theorem has a `∀` symbol, as in `∀ a b : S, a + b = b + a`, you need to
specify what `a` and `b` you mean to use before using `.symm`. For example, you would have to write
`rw[(h 2 3).symm]`.

One last hint is that when writing `0`, you often want to specify which zero you are talking about.
We know that the natural numbers, for example, has a `0`, but so do the Field K and the Abelian Group
V, and those `0`s are different. To specify which `0` you are talking about, write `(0 : K)` or `(0 : V)`.

### Note on simp and linarith

In this world, we are primarilly proving simple statements about vector spaces. This is exactly what
the `simp` and `linarith` tactics are meant to do. In fact, the `simp` tactic alone would be able to
solve the first three levels of this world. Because of this, you will not be able to use those tactics
in this world.

A vector space is a space over a field K with an abelian group V. It has four main properties:
- Distributivity over vector addition,
- Distributivity over scalar addition,
- Associativity of scalar multiplication,
- Identity scalar acting as identity.

These properties can be found in the theorems tab as "smul_add", "add_smul", "mul_smul", and "one_smul".

It is called "zero_smul_v", since you perform scalar multiplication by zero. The "v" means that it is

`theorem_name K V theorem_args`. This lets Lean know what vector space you are working with."
