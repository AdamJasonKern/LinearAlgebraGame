Title "Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality"

Introduction "
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is one of the most fundamental inequalities in mathematics. It states that for any two vectors `u` and `v` in an inner product space:

$$|\\langle u, v \\rangle| \\leq \\|u\\| \\cdot \\|v\\|$$

This inequality has deep geometric meaning: the absolute value of the inner product (which relates to the cosine of the angle between vectors) is bounded by the product of their lengths. This ensures that when we define angles using inner products, the cosine stays between -1 and 1.

## The Goal
We prove this using orthogonal decomposition. The key insight is to decompose `u` relative to `v` as `u = c • v + w` where `w` is orthogonal to `v`. Then we use the Pythagorean theorem and algebraic manipulation to establish the inequality.

## The Strategy
1. Handle the case `v = 0` separately (trivial)
2. For `v ≠ 0`, use orthogonal decomposition: `u = c • v + w` with `w ⊥ v`  
3. Apply Pythagorean theorem: `‖u‖² = ‖c • v‖² + ‖w‖²`
4. Since `‖w‖² ≥ 0`, we get `‖u‖² ≥ ‖c • v‖²`
5. Substitute `c = ⟪u,v⟫ / ‖v‖²` and algebraically simplify
"

/--
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: `‖⟪u,v⟫‖ ≤ ‖u‖ * ‖v‖` for any vectors `u` and `v`.
This is one of the most important inequalities in linear algebra and analysis.
