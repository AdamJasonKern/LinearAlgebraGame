Title "Orthogonality With Self"

Introduction "
We now introduce orthogonality. Two vectors being orthogonal is equivalent to having their inner product
be 0. In Lean, we write this as

```
def orthogonal (u v : V) : Prop := ⟪u, v⟫ = (0 : ℂ)
```

## The Goal
In this level, we show that the only vector that is orthogonal to itself is the zero vector.
This proof is very similar to our axiom `inner_self_eq_zero`
"

`orthogonal` is how we say vectors are orthogonal. The syntax is `orthogonal v w`. This means that the
inner product of `v` and `w` is `0`. In Lean, we define it by saying

```
def orthogonal (u v : V) : Prop := ⟪u, v⟫ = (0 : ℂ)
```

`ortho_self_zero` is a proof that the only vector orthogonal to itself is the zero vector. If `v` is
a vector, `ortho_self_zero v` is a proof that `ortho v v ↔ v = 0`.
