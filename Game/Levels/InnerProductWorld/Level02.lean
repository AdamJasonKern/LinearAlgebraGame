Title "Zero Norm if and only if Zero Vector"

Introduction "
## The Goal
In this level, we prove that the norm of a vector is zero if and only if it is the zero vector. The
idea of the proof is to use the `inner_self_eq_zero` axiom, which requires cancelling out the square
roots.

## The `apply_fun` tactic
The `apply_fun` tactic is used to apply functions to both sides of an equality. This only works in your
hypotheses, not in the goal. The syntax is `apply_fun (fun x => f x) at h`. If `h : a = b` is a proof,
then this will change `h` to `h : f a = f b`. This tactic can be very helpful, as squaring a square root
cancels out the operation.

## Summary
`apply_fun` allows you to apply functions to both sides of an equality in the hypothesis. This can also
be done simply with a `have`, `rw`, and `rfl` statement, but it is nice to be able to do that in one line.

## Example
If you have `h : sqrt x = 0`, using `apply_fun (fun v => v ^ 2) at h` will change `h` to `h : (sqrt x) ^ 2 = 0 ^ 2`.

`sq_sqrt` is a proof that if `0 ≤ x`, then `(sqrt x) ^ 2 = x`. It allows you to cancel out square roots.

`Complex.ext` allows you to split complex numbers into their real and imaginary parts. If your goal is
of the form `a = b`, where `(a b : ℂ)`, then `apply Complex.ext` will create two goals, one `a.re = b.re`,
and the other `a.im = b.im`.

`norm_zero_v` is a proof that `‖v‖ = 0 ↔ v = 0`, or that the only vector with norm zero is the zero vector.
