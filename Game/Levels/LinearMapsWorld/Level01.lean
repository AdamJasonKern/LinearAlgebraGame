Title "What is a Linear Map?"

Introduction "
In this level, we introduce the fundamental concept of a **linear map** between vector spaces.

## The Core Idea

A linear map (also called a linear transformation) is a function between vector spaces that preserves the essential vector space operations: addition and scalar multiplication.

## Mathematical Definition

Given vector spaces $V$ and $W$ over a field $K$, a function $T : V \\to W$ is called **linear** if it satisfies these two properties:

1. **Additivity:** $T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)$ for all $u, v \\in V$
2. **Homogeneity:** $T(a \\cdot v) = a \\cdot T(v)$ for all $a \\in K$ and $v \\in V$

## Why This Matters

Linear maps are the structure-preserving functions of linear algebra. They respect the vector space structure, making them the natural morphisms to study between vector spaces.

### Your Goal
Prove that our definition captures exactly these two fundamental properties.

**Educational Definition: Linear Map**

A function `T : V → W` between vector spaces is called *linear* if it preserves
vector addition and scalar multiplication.

This follows Axler's Definition 3.1: A function T : V → W is called a linear map if
T(u + v) = Tu + Tv and T(av) = aTv for all u, v ∈ V and all a ∈ F.

Conclusion "
You have formalized the fundamental definition of a linear map.

Linear maps are the backbone of linear algebra - they preserve the structure we care about. In the next levels, you'll explore what linear maps do to special sets like the null space and range.
