Title "Linear Maps Preserve Dimensions"

Introduction "
Now we'll explore how linear maps interact with the dimensions of vector spaces.

## The Key Insight

If $T : V \\to W$ is a linear map, then the dimension of $V$ equals the dimension of the null space plus the dimension of the range:

$$\\dim V = \\dim(\\text{null } T) + \\dim(\\text{range } T)$$

This prepares us for the **Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra**.

## Why This Matters

This relationship shows that linear maps have a very structured effect on dimensions. The input space gets 'split' between the null space (what gets mapped to zero) and the range (what gets output).

## Building Toward Axler 3.21

This level establishes a key property we'll need for the Fundamental Theorem. We'll prove that linear maps cannot increase dimension beyond certain bounds.

### Your Goal
Prove that if T : V → W is injective, then the range has the same dimension as the domain.

Conclusion "
You've proven that injective linear maps preserve the 'non-zero-ness' of vectors!

This is a crucial step toward understanding how linear maps interact with independence and dimension. Injective maps preserve the essential structure needed for basis theory.
