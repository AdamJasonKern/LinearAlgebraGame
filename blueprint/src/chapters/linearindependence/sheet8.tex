  Let $S$ be a linearly independent set and $v$ be a vector not in the span of $S$. Then the set $S \cup \{v\}$ is also linearly independent.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose we have a linear combination $\sum_{s \in S} a_s s + a_v v = 0$. If $a_v \neq 0$, then we could solve for $v = -\frac{1}{a_v}\sum_{s \in S} a_s s$, which would mean $v \in \text{span}(S)$, contradicting our assumption. Therefore $a_v = 0$, and since $S$ is linearly independent, we must have $a_s = 0$ for all $s \in S$.
\end{proof}
