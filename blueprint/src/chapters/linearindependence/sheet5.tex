  If $A$ is a linearly independent set and $B \subseteq A$, then $B$ is also linearly independent.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose we have a linear combination $\sum_{v \in B} a_v v = 0$ where $a_v \in K$. Since $B \subseteq A$, this is also a linear combination of vectors in $A$ that equals zero. By the linear independence of $A$, we must have $a_v = 0$ for all $v \in B$. Therefore $B$ is linearly independent.
