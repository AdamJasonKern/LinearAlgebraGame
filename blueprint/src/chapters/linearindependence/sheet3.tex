  The span operation is monotonic: if $A \subseteq B$, then $\text{span}(A) \subseteq \text{span}(B)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $v \in \text{span}(A)$. Then $v$ is a linear combination of vectors in $A$. Since $A \subseteq B$, these same vectors are also in $B$, so $v$ is also a linear combination of vectors in $B$. Therefore $v \in \text{span}(B)$.
\end{proof}
