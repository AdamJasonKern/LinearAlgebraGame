\chapter{Tutorial World}

This world introduces basic concepts of Lean 4 and formal theorem proving. Players learn fundamental tactics and proof techniques through simple mathematical statements.

\section{Basic Tactics and Reflexivity}

\begin{lemma}
\label{tutorial-reflexivity}
\uses{}
For any element $x$, we have $x = x$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This follows directly from the reflexivity of equality. In Lean, this is proven using the \texttt{rfl} tactic.
\end{proof}

\section{Natural Numbers and Induction}

The tutorial world introduces basic properties of natural numbers and the principle of mathematical induction.

\begin{lemma}
\label{tutorial-zero-add}
\uses{}
For any natural number $n$, we have $0 + n = n$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
\label{tutorial-add-zero}
\uses{}
For any natural number $n$, we have $n + 0 = n$.
\end{lemma}

\section{Proof Techniques}

Students learn essential proof techniques including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Direct proof using \texttt{exact}
    \item Rewriting using \texttt{rw}
    \item Function application using \texttt{apply}
    \item Introduction of assumptions using \texttt{intro}
    \item Simplification using \texttt{simp}
    \item Mathematical induction using \texttt{induction'}
\end{itemize}
