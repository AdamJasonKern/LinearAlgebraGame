\section{Multiplying By The Zero Vector}

  In any vector space $V$ over field $K$, scalar multiplication of any scalar by the zero vector yields the zero vector:
  $$\forall a \in K: \quad a \cdot 0 = 0$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  This follows from the distributive property of scalar multiplication and the fact that $0 + 0 = 0$.
